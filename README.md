## Project description <a name="description"></a>
this project is meant to demonstrate the principals of sampling and its effect on data acquisition in digital signals.

## Features overview: <a name="overview"></a>
  ### 1. Importing/ Saving signal as csv file
  ![import section photo](screenshots/import_section.jpg)


  supports importing of csv file and plot it on the signal viewer
  and can also save the signal displayed as a csv file.

  ### 2. Adding sinusoidal components of different frequencies

  ![composer section photo](screenshots/composer_section.jpg)

  you can add sinusoidal components of different magnitudes and frequencies to the signal, components will be added to the drop down list and can be

  ### 3. Adding white gaussian noise
  ![noise section photo](screenshots/noise_section.jpg)

  The application allows the user to add white gaussian noise with a controllable SNR, and then toggle it if they want to deal with the original signal

  ### 4. Reconstructing a signal using sinc interpolation
  ![reconstruction section photo](screenshots/reconstruction_section.jpg)

  The program uses 1 dimensional Shannon-Whittaker interpolation to demonstrate the Nquist theorem for sampling of bandwidth limited signals.

## Project Structure:
1. `class sigProcessing()` \
  Object that stores the information related to the signal, as well as the methods used for the processes.
  1. `constructor()`
      * contains all info related to the graph object, parameters to passed to plotly.js\
      `layout{}, data{}, etc`
      * Contains the resolution and length for the original signal\
      `this.time = 5;`\
      `this.step = 0.001;`

  2. `generate(amp, f, time = this.time, step = this.step)`\
    Generates sinusoidal component using sin(wt)
  3. `sampling(samplingRate, data=this.data)`\
   Parameter for sampling rate, and data to be sampled (normal data or noisy)
  4. `reconstructSig(samplingRate)` \
  reconstructs the signal using 1Dimensional sinc interpolation
  5. `generateNoise(SNR)` \
  Generate white gaussian noise (using boxMullerTransform) based on the SNR value input
  6.`updateGraph(samplingRate, noiseOn=noiseToggle.checked)` \
  Updates the graph with the current signals, called after every click to ensure graph is refreshed \
  note: noiseToggle flag is used to check which signal to show (original/noisy)
  7.`getNormalDistRand(mean, stddev)` \
  Generates the randomly distributed numbers (by calling the `boxMullerTransform()` method)
  8. `addSignal(amp, freq)` \
  For adding component from the signal mixer onto the current signal (using user input as parameters)
  9. `deleteSignal(signalName)` \
  Calls the signal to be deleted from the signalList, then deletes it from the data

## Project file structure:

1. app.py/ _init_.py/ Route.py/ file that runs the localhost server
2. templates/ contains HTML
2. Static/
  1. /css: contains the stylesheets used
  2. /js: contains the scripts used
    1. /frame_scripts.js: Handles the interactions done on the page
    2. /processing.js: Has the class for the `sigProcessing()` object, which handles the interactions on the signal
